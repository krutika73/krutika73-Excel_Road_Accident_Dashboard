Accident Analysis Dashboard: This project involves the meticulous cleaning and transformation of data using Excel, followed by the creation of insightful visualizations through the implementation of pivot tables. The result is a comprehensive dashboard designed to enhance accident analysis and provide valuable insights.

# Overview
This project entails the development of a comprehensive Road Accident Analysis Dashboard for the years 2021 and 2022. The dataset comprises an extensive 3.07 million rows and 21 fields, including critical information such as accident index, date, accident severity, road surface type, light conditions, road type, and location.

# Methodology
The project follows a structured approach, starting with meticulous data cleaning. Duplicate entries and typo errors were systematically removed to ensure data accuracy. Subsequently, data transformation was conducted using a variety of Excel formulas for text, date, and numeric fields. The final stage involved creating impactful visualizations through the strategic implementation of pivot tables.

# Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
The primary focus of the dashboard revolves around two crucial KPIs:

* Total Casualties: Determining the overall casualties post-accident.
* Casualties by Severity and Vehicle Type: Analyzing the percentage distribution of total casualties concerning accident severity and identifying the vehicle types contributing to maximum casualties.

# Secondary KPIs
The dashboard also addresses secondary KPIs, including:

*Casualties by Vehicle Type: Providing insights into the distribution of casualties based on the type of vehicle.
*Monthly Trends: Comparing casualties between the current and previous years on a monthly basis.
*Maximum Casualties by Road Type: Identifying road types associated with the highest casualties.
*Distribution by Road Surface: Understanding the distribution of total casualties based on road surface conditions.
*Relation between Casualties and Area/Location, Day/Night: Examining the correlation between casualties, geographical location, and time of day.

# Stakeholders
